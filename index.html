    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>More than 90% of early learners had their education disrupted by COVID-19, resulting in many missing vital early childhood experiences interacting with adults and peers outside their families. Many students are now lagging socially, and younger generations are often described as “shy.”</p>

    <ul>

      <li>More things are documented online</li>
      <li>Social media</li>
      <li>Less opportunities for in-person interaction past 5 years because of COVID</li>
    </ul>
