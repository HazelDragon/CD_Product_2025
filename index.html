Week 1: Preliminary Start-Up Pitch

AR Glasses for Etiquette Training : A fun way to level the playing field 

Problem: 
More than 90% of early learners had their education disrupted by covid, and as a result many lost vital early childhood experiences in interacting with adults and children outside of their families. Many students are now lagging behind developmentally socially, and younger generations are described as “shy”. 

5 Whys:
Why is Gen Z / younger kids be described as more anxious
Higher stakes for performance in everyday life
More things are documented online
Social media
Less opportunities for in-person interaction past 5 yrs bc of covid


Solution:
Lets gamify social interaction! And also make children who have social anxiety or speech delays feel less anxious while interacting with others! 


Features:
Real-time body language reader – Computer Vision trained on people?
Point system, but you only get points if you follow etiquette – No losing points
Add friends, practice with friends – friends double points
Co-pilot mode v AR person for practice



vrbatim is the app that allows kids to help feel less anxious when interacting with others by giving live feedback of non-verbal cues/ nudges?
